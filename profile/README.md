**Empowering Cloud-Native Transformations with Infrastructure as Code**

Welcome to **Mosher Labs**, where Scandinavian heritage meets cutting-edge technology.
Inspired by the resilience and ingenuity of the Vikings, we craft modern solutions with the
precision of a single-bladed axe. Our passion lies in delivering scalable, reliable, and
repeatable solutions that harness the full potential of Kubernetes (k8s), Terraform (TF),
Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
